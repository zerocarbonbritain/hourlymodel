<h2>Creating a community scale ZeroCarbonBritain scenario</h2>

<p>The ZeroCarbonBritain hourly energy model is a national scenario that shows how we can power every aspect of our lives with renewable zero carbon energy. As a national scenario it is the sum of all of our efforts, from changes we make in our own homes, community scale projects to larger national infrastructure – and as such it’s possible to turn the model around and ask what might a ZeroCarbonBritain scenario for my village, town or region look like?</p>

<p>We can do this in the most simple way by scaling the results of the national model to the number of households in our local area. In addition to household energy use, the results cover a fair share of services, industrial energy use and the zero carbon technology required to meet all of this demand.</p>

<p>The following guide walks through the process of creating a community or regional scale ZeroCarbonBritain scenario using the Machynlleth region where the Centre for Alternative Technology is based:</p>

<h3>1) Find the number of households in the region you are interested in</h3>

<p><b>Census data 2011</b></p>

<table class="table">
<tr><th></th><th>Households</th><th>Population</th><th>Area (hectares)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Machynlleth</td><td>1033</td><td>2235</td><td>506</td></tr>
<tr><td>Corris/Mawddwy</td><td>624</td><td>1345</td><td>16,490</td></tr>
<tr><td>Glantwymyn</td><td>890</td><td>2040</td><td>22,168</td></tr>
</table>

<p>From the most recent census data, the Machynlleth, Corris, Mawddwy and Glantwymyn area has 5620 residents, or 2547 households. To help with this process we have started to build a tool to access this census data much easier, currently covering electoral wards in Wales only: <a href="https://openenergymonitor.org/zcbmap" target="_blank">https://openenergymonitor.org/zcbmap</a></p>

<h3>2) Open the ZeroCarbonBritain energy model</h3>

<h3>3) Navigate to the “SCALED TO VILLAGE, TOWN, CITY or COUNTRY” tab</h3>

<p>Enter the number of households to scale the ZeroCarbonBritain model results accordingly:</p>

<p>These results show the share of national renewable energy, storage, backup, synthetic gas, liquid and land area required to meet the demand.</p>

<p>The demand itself assumes all of the standard assumptions for electrical appliances, insulation and draft proofing, heating systems, transport, services and industrial demand that the full ZeroCarbonBritain scenario explores.</p>

<p>What does 11 MW of offshore wind and 2.6 MW of onshore wind mean for the Machynlleth area? It turns out that there already exists a 15.3 MW onshore wind farm and a 0.5 MW community wind turbine within the scenario area which go a long way to meeting the scenario suggestions. There is also a fair number of solar and small hydro generators in the area.</p>

<table class="table">
<tr><td>BroDyfi Nordtank:</td><td>500kW, 0.743 GWh (17% CF)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cemmaes Wind Farm</td><td>15.3 MW, 38.9 GWh (29% CF)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some of the backup and power-to-gas technologies may be better suited to larger scale centralised sites but it still gives an idea of what the ZCB scenario suggests is needed.</p>

<p>We can use these results to start to visualise what the ZCB scenario might look like in our own area, perhaps with the suggested number of wind turbines up on a near by hill, an electrolysis and power to gas plant in a local industrial park or nearby farm and a community scale battery storage unit at the end of the street.</p>

<p>We can start to grapple with the questions of how do we balance power down reduction in consumption and energy efficiency with supply side power up solutions. A more ambitious local plan to retrofit housing to lower space heating demand means that less wind turbines and associated infrastructure may be needed up on the hill or out at sea.</p>

<p>The model is a tool to aid with this process of visualisation and to help answer these questions, the default ZCB scenario is one possible mix of behaviour change and technological solutions for building a zero carbon future.
